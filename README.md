# MissingPersons

Welcome to Missing Persons. This app is designed to make it easy to search through the FBI missing persons database. Missing Persons will not show you a picture of an individual but will give you the person's url information where you can get further details, including their picture. This app will also allow you to see all the people in the FBI database by simply scrolling down the list of names.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
bin/run_missing_persons
```

## Usage

Run the app by typing `bin/run_missing_persons` in terminal. The app will have a welcome message. It will then display a list of names, to make a selection choose the number prior to a personâ€™s name. This will give you more details about the person. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
